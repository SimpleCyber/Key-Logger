# Browser Key Logger - Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension logs key presses from users on any webpage and stores them locally. The extension automatically submits the logs when a set word count is reached. It also includes features to toggle the color of a UI box and trigger button events.

## Features

1. **Key Logging:**
   - Logs every key press excluding system keys like `CapsLock`, `Shift`, `Control`, etc.
   - Replaces `Backspace` with the ðŸŽƒ emoji and handles `Enter` as a newline.
   - Automatically submits the log when the word count exceeds 5.

2. **UI Interaction:**
   - Color box that toggles between red and green.
   - Button A triggers Button B, which changes the color of the box.

3. **Storage and Submission:**
   - Logs are stored in Chrome's local storage.
   - Logs are auto-submitted after reaching a word count of 5.
   - Option to clear the logs.
